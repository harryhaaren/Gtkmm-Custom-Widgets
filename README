			GTKMM CUSTOM WIDGETS

This repo reflects my learing of Gtkmm custom widget drawing.
Most of the code is pretty ok i think, its not "100% PC" some of the time.

I have'nt optimized the loops or done any fancy tricks, as its kinda
my sandbox for learning. Hope its of use to yee.

To Use, Open a terminal in the folder you want and then:
./waf configure
./waf
./run.sh

Note: For the WaveView loadFile version, you NEED to copy the foo.flac
file into the build/default dir. Otherwise it wont show anything.
